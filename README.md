# About me

I'm am engineer working on the [e6data](https://www.e6data.com/) lakehouse engine.

Prior to this, I was a research engineering working for the [Engineering for Research e4r](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-in/clients/engineering-research) group in Thoughtworks. My work was in the areas of High Performance Computing (MPI, OpenMP, SIMD) and Accelerated Computing (Cuda/RoCM, HLS).

I do some creative frontend design from time to time.
